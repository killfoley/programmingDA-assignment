### Numpy.random package in Python
Details of the assignment are to create a Jupyter notebook exploring the following
* Explain the overall purpose of the numpy.random package.
* Explain the use of the “Simple random data” and “Permutations” functions.
* Explain the use and purpose of at least five “Distributions” functions.
* Explain the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers.
  
### Numpy.random
Numpy.random is a routine (function/ package) in the Numpy library for Python that produces pseudo random numbers to sample from different statistical distributions.

### Installation
It is recommended to install NumPy via the Anaconda distribution which includes Python, NumPy and other commonly used libraries for data analysis and scientific computing.
Using the conda installer it can be installed using
```
conda install numpy
```
### Running the file
Clone the repository to your local machine and launch Jupyter Notebook from the same repository to start using the notebook.

### Numpy and Numpy.random Usage
Frst import numpy as np into the Jupyter Notebook.
  ```
  import numpy as np
  ```
Next use the default random number generator (rng) to start generating pseud orandom numbers 
  ```
  rng = np.random.default_rng()
  ```
